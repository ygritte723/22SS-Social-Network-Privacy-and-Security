#### About IPRoyal-monetize the internet traffic

##### Background 

As we all know, mobile data is a precious commodity these days. If your internet service provider offers a limited data plan, you know how **expensive crossing that line** can get. On the other hand, if you have more bandwidth than you need or you're blessed with a flat-rate connection, you could sell it and make some extra money. This is where the IPRoyal Pawns app comes in.

##### How does it work?

By sharing your internet connection through the IPRoyal Pawns app, business partners can access the web from your location. That way, you help others view the internet as it is perceived by real people - without any location restrictions or censorship. 

IPRoyal has developed an Application that **enables Users to share their internet traffic** via their device with IPRoyal and its Clients. The User’s device becomes a **gateway** which allows IPRoyal to send and receive internet traffic. This traffic is used by IPRoyal and its Clients. There’s really no point in installing it on multiple computers connected to the same network since the program will only be able to read one IP address.

##### Frequent cases:

- Corporate Intelligence and SEO

- Brand Awareness and Protection

- Advertising Verification

  Some will use it to gain access to geo-blocked content, while some companies will use it to check whether their ads are running correctly and showing up on the right websites.

- Software Testing

  Some companies will use your unused bandwidth to enhance their testing process to improve their apps so that their users will experience the app content as it was meant to.

- Content Distribution

- Market Research

##### Security

- All our clients need to confirm their identity by providing their name and valid documents. That way, we know who they are. We also make sure all the traffic our trusted partners use is 100% safe.
- The app itself has no access to your storage and does not gather any personal data. We only use the information needed to make the service work - your **IP address, network speed, and location**. All traffic is fully encrypted, so there are no compromises in terms of privacy. We don't bundle any additional software with the installation, and the app itself contains no ads.
- Payment: Unlike other similar solutions that pay in obscure cryptocurrencies, IPRoyal Pawns pays cash via PayPal and Bitcon.  And it pays you 0.20USD per GB shared.
- IPRoyal does **not** plan or intend to collect any personal information on children below the age of 14 or any other age that requires approval or consent of a parental responsibility holder for the purpose of collection and/or processing of personal data of such an individual.

It turns out to be a common kind of .exe bug, and it can happen to any software.  Sometimes app crash and we relaunch it again without closing last application.  However it's not related with chrome problems or hacking. IPRoyal monitors all traffic that it would be used only on legal cases. Also nobody can connect to your computer through IPRoyal pawns only your IP and your traffic are used.

While stating that it would be more efficient to have an independent industry regulator, Toleikis described the various self-regulatory measures that his company has taken to ensure that scraping is done ethically and data is not used for malicious acts. 

“We closely monitor all clients’ requests for unusual patterns,” Toleikis said. “If we notice more requests than usual, we suspend the account immediately and ask the client to provide more details about that particular case”. He also adds that his practice has proved to be 100% effective so far.”

In the absence of a blanket constitutional framework that governs the practice, Toleikis opines that internet users need to get better educated about the legal implications of the activities that they carry out on the internet as well as information that they share.
